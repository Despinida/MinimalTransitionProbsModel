# MinimalTransitionProbsModel

This is the companion repository for the following article:
Human inference about sequences: a minimal transition-probability model
Florent MEYNIEL, Maxime MAHEU and Stanislas DEHAENE

The repository contains the codes to reproduce the simulations and fits presented in the paper.
Florent MEYNIEL and Maxime MAHEU developed all the codes provided. 

The code is written for MATLAB, we tested it in the version 2016a.

The repository is organized in different folders:
- IdealObserversCode: contains the codes for various Ideal Observers presented in the article and use of the simulation. Toy examples are provided.
- Squires1976: code for fitting the electrophysiological data from Squires et al 1976 and Kolossa et al 2013 (Figure 3 in the paper).
- Huettel2002: code to simulate the sequential effects revealed by Huettel et al 2002 (Figure 4 and S2 in the paper)
- Cho2002: code to simulate the sequential effects revealed by Cho et al 2002 (Figure 5 and S3 in the paper)
- RandomnessPerception: code to simulate the perceived randomness of sequences like in Falk and Konold 1997 (Figure 6 in the paper)
- Tools: contains several useful functions.
